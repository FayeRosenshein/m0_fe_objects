# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

  * I struggled with making things more simple. I was trying to do everything the assignment asked for in one line of code and I didn't need to. I asked my group what they were doing and it was really helpful to have someone talk through my problems and solve them together.


- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

  * I find myself taking the best notes pre and post lesson. I will take notes while I am reading through the lesson and then I will save the code I have created and write notes that I think will be helpful later or that I know I will have a hard time remembering.


- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

  * I try really hard to solve code on my own first, then I will look into google to try and complete the task and if that still doesn't work I will ask my group mates for help and if that still doesn't work I will take a break or move on to the next task and come back to my block.
